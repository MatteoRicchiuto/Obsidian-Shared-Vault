## Definizione

- **Combinational logic** is a type of digital logic which is implemented by Boolean circuits where the output is a [[Algebra Booleana#Funzioni Booleane|pure function]] of the present *input only*. 
- This is in contrast to [[Circuiti sequenziali|sequential logic]], in which the output depends not only on the present *input* but also on the *history of the input*. In other words, sequential logic has memory while combinational logic does not.
