## What is Rust?

Rust is one of the most popular programming languages in recent times. Here're some of the features of Rust that make it so popular:

- **Platform Independent** - You can compile a Rust program on one platform and run it on another platform.
- **Performance** - Rust is one of the fastest programming languages. Not only that, but it also requires less memory, which makes it a highly efficient language.
- **Safe Concurrency** - Rust doesn't allow programs to modify the same value simultaneously while running the concurrent program.
- **Memory Safety** - Rust also provides memory safety to prevent unexpected crashes of its program.

## What is used for?

It is a general purpose programming language that is extensively used to build:

- **kernels** for operating systems
- **game engines** for video games
- **browser** engines for web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, etc.
- **command-line tools**, and so on.
