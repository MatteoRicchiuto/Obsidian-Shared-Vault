## What is a comment?
In computer programming, comments are lines of text used to describe the purpose of code. For example,
``` rust
// entry point of the program
fn main() {
    // print text on the screen
    println!("Hello, World!");
```

## Types of Comments

There are two important types of comments in Rust:

- `//` - Line Comment
- `/*...*/` - Block Comment

**Note:** In the Rust ecosystem, line comments are preferred over block comments.
